# Hotel-Booking-Cancellation-Capstone
Capstone Project - Predicting Hotel Booking Cancellations using Machine Learning

This repository contains the end-to-end analysis and machine learning model to predict hotel booking cancellations.

# Business Objective
To help hotels anticipate booking cancellations so they can optimize room availability and reduce financial losses.

## Project Highlights
- Binary classification task (Target: `is_canceled`)
- Model used: Random Forest Classifier
- Metric focus: F1 Score for class 1 (cancellation)
- Final Model Performance:
  - F1 Score: 0.74
  - Recall: 0.82
  - Precision: 0.71
